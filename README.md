# Outfit-Organizer

## Project Description

This project was created as the first group project for the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. We set out to create an application that can help the user pick which outfit to wear each day. The application includes a widget powered by the Weather API displaying the weather at the user's location, to help the user dress accordingly. The application includes a color palette generator powered by the Colormind API, to offer the user inspiration when picking an outfit.
